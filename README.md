# Submission Instructions

At 5:00pm on the deadline, the instructor will download your submission. If a *grademe.md* file exists, your assignment will be graded. If it does not exist, we will assume you are using your slip days. After 2 days, if you have not submitted a grademe.md file, we will assume you are not turning in the assignment and we will give you a zero.

If you submit your assignment (by renaming submit.md to grademe.md) and later change your mind that you didn't want to submit your assignment yet, simply renaming grademe.md back to submit.md. Make sure you change your mind before 5:00pm. After 5:00pm if there's a grademe.me file, we will grade your assignment. Once your assignment has been graded, you cannot use your slip days.

**Always check GitHub to make sure you submitted your assignment.** Forgetting to submit (push) is no excuse. If you forget, you'll have to use your slip days. If you don't have any more slip days, you'll get a zero. No exceptions.
