        <p>A semester-long group project, <i>Scents of Smell</i> is an interactive
          gamified scent diffuser powered by an Arduino board that allows users to
          test their senses of smell by guessing which two (of eight) randomly
          emitted scents they detect. Currently, many existing smelling games are for pets,
          but humansâ€™ olfactory senses are just as important. Realizing this shortcoming,
          then, we created <i>Scents of Smell</i>. With just the press of a button,
          two randoms scent are emitted from the house-shaped prototype for players to
          guess what they smell, and a flash of light will automatically provide feedback
          on whether or not the guess was right. With this prototype, we hope that
          people of all ages can have a simpler, more technologically advanced, and
          funner device to test their senses of smell with.</p>
